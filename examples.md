## Example prompts / tasks to test aider and/or cline:

### ðŸ’¡ something practical:
- Write me a python app with which I can read and visualize my data set.

You could also think about helpful scripts and tasks those friendly agents could solve for you via tiny but helpful scripts once and for all.
Think about your daily work

### ðŸŽ¨ something inspiring:
- Write me a python app that displays a working keyboard of a C major scale that also outputs notes. 

Lets see how this works out but this could be a good example of not expecting too much and solving (complex) tasks incrementally.
What could we add here?

### ðŸ•¹ lets make a game:
- ask the model first what could be simple but funny games to build (e.g. in python)
- after some back and forth discussing let it code a game

This could also be a creative way to learn how to use these agents efficiently by developing your own mini-game.
